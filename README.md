# Regression_NN_Plain_Tensorflow
Hello
Using Plain Tensorflow for making a regression model

showing a simple example of using tensorflow for regression model by tf.layers.dense to create hidden layers of Neural Network.

The idea behind the example is to create a model by calling the csv format of dataset and make it ready for the model.
